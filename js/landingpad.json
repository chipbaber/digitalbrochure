Over the course of about an hour we will leverage a tool called the Ideation Value Map to discuss and identify the aspects of Development Operations that would be of most interest for your organization. There is no need to prep for this session, our tool is designed to guide you and your Ideator through the process and output a custom engagement plan report for you to review.",

With specialized skill sets, corporate policies and in-flight workloads it sometimes takes days for a OS to be installed, added to the network and enabled for use. We feel leveraging Docker/Oracle Cloud approach could enable re-usable configurations that would speed up IT delivery and enable more consistant operations.

Our developers can quickly build a Docker container with the specific features they need and run the container locally on in-house servers if there is capacity or more likely push the container to the Oracle Cloud. With the Cloud we feel our developers could have a working personalized environment up and running in an about an hour. Once then environment is running they will have the flexibility to immediately develop or quickly delete and re-build the containers from scratch as and when needed for Q/A and test environments.",

 "leadertext":"We learned four lessons during our Accelerate journey. First, this architecture is highly repeatable. It really provides a nice way for use to create consistant containers based on our IT standards. Second, deployment of environments is much easier than our current process, especially if we are able to leverage the cloud and the existing management interfaces. Third, is the ability to recover from errors. No one is perfect in development, and sometime small mistakes have costs days or weeks of troubleshooting. With Oracle we could simply delete and rebuilt the container knowing all the standards are in place. Last but not least is networking, if we implement this idea, we will need to coordinate with the networking team and possibile open/secure communication ports to the cloud.",
